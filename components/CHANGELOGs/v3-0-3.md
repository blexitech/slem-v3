## v3.0.3 â€“ Deployment stabilization, wallet UX, and build optimizations

Short summary
- We stabilized AWS Amplify SSR deployment by switching to webpack, fixing CSS, and publishing the correct build artifacts. Wallet UX was cleaned up (connect button, address display), AppKit moved to a proper client setup with Testnet defaults and USDC visibility, and unused deps were removed.

Bugs fixed
- Fixed invalid Google Fonts import in `app/globals.css` (nested `@import url(...)` causing webpack error).
- Removed invalid `<createAppKit>` JSX wrapper and server-side AppKit init from `app/layout.js`.
- Corrected email example that attempted `await` inside JSX (moved to server action, then later removed with admin route for size).
- Resolved React context/runtime error from `@boringer-avatars/react` by removing the dependency and replacing with a safe avatar/image approach.
- Addressed repeated Amplify failures: ensured required Next trace files are published and aligned artifacts to what Amplify expects.

New implementation features and changes
- AppKit setup moved to `app/clientLayout.js` (client init). Enabled network switch; default network set to Solana Testnet; themed accent and history feature enabled.
- USDC visibility added via `defaultTokens` (mainnet and testnet mints) so balances appear by default.
- `app/menu/page.jsx` registers AppKit web component and renders `<appkit-button />` correctly.
- New `components/BUTTONs/ConnectWallet.jsx` with `useAppKitAccount`/`useAppKit`, connect/account views, and middle-truncated wallet address.
- Switched build tool from Turbopack to webpack (`package.json` scripts updated) for smaller SSR output on Amplify.
- Simplified `next.config.mjs` (compression, headers, externals) and kept SSR-compatible settings.
- AWS Amplify pipeline reworked: simplified `amplify.yml` to build then publish `.next` directly as artifacts; added size logs for visibility.
- Removed `@boringer-avatars/react` to avoid React 18 peer conflicts with React 19.
- Cleaned up repository ignores and packaging to avoid oversized artifacts.

Notes
- The previous admin dashboard route was removed to minimize SSR output size for Amplify. Reintroduce later behind optimized patterns if needed.
