## v3.0.5 â€“ Hybrid Storage Architecture: Arweave + Supabase Integration

Short summary
- Implemented hybrid storage architecture combining decentralized Arweave storage with centralized Supabase database. Added automatic user registration on wallet connection, profile management system, and comprehensive data handling for sensitive user information. Fixed Supabase connection issues and environment variable configuration.

Bugs fixed
- Resolved Supabase environment variable mismatch: code was looking for NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY but .env.local had NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHED_KEY
- Fixed ReadableStream errors in server actions caused by improper client-side Supabase usage in server-side functions
- Corrected Supabase table schema mismatch: updated code to use "V3 Users" table with correct column names (walletAddress, arweaveUrl)
- Resolved server action execution failures due to improper Supabase client initialization

New implementation features and changes
- Added hybrid storage architecture:
  - Sensitive data (full name, username, date of birth, email) stored on Arweave (permanent, decentralized)
  - Reference data (wallet address, Arweave URL) stored on Supabase (fast queries, centralized)
- Implemented automatic user registration system:
  - Users automatically added to Supabase "V3 Users" table when connecting wallet
  - Tracks all connected users regardless of profile completion status
  - Prevents duplicate user registrations with proper existence checks
- Added comprehensive profile management:
  - Create new user profiles with full form validation
  - Edit existing profiles with pre-populated data
  - View current profile information with storage confirmation
  - All profile operations stored permanently on Arweave network
- Created server-side Supabase client (lib/supabase-server.js):
  - Proper server action integration without ReadableStream errors
  - Dedicated functions for insert, get, update, and upsert operations
  - Clean separation between client-side and server-side Supabase usage
- Updated GreetingBox component:
  - Simplified to show personalized greetings based on profile status
  - Displays "Hello, [username]!" for users with profiles
  - Shows "Hello, User!" with settings hint for users without profiles
  - Removed complex profile creation forms from main interface
- Enhanced Settings page:
  - Complete profile creation and editing functionality
  - Form validation for all required fields (full name, username, date of birth, email)
  - Real-time error handling and loading states
  - Storage confirmation showing Arweave + Supabase integration
- Added Arweave integration:
  - Permanent storage of sensitive user data
  - Transaction tagging for data organization
  - Wallet balance checking functionality
  - Data retrieval and search capabilities
- Implemented React hooks for hybrid operations:
  - useHybridUser hook for seamless profile management
  - Automatic loading states and error handling
  - Profile existence checking and user registration
- Added comprehensive error handling:
  - Network error management for both Arweave and Supabase
  - Graceful fallbacks when one service fails
  - User-friendly error messages and loading indicators

Notes
- Users are now automatically tracked in Supabase when they connect their wallet
- Sensitive data is permanently stored on Arweave and cannot be deleted or modified
- Profile management is centralized in the Settings page for better UX
- The system provides both decentralization benefits (Arweave) and performance benefits (Supabase)
- All user data operations include proper error handling and user feedback
- Environment variables must be properly configured for both Arweave and Supabase services
