## v3.0.4 â€“ Menu Navigation Links, Motion Package Integration and Deployment Fix

Short summary
- Added comprehensive menu navigation links including internal app routes and external social media links. Added motion package (12.23.22) for enhanced animations and updated Next.js to version 15.5.4. Fixed AWS Amplify deployment failure by resolving package dependency synchronization issues.

Bugs fixed

- Addressed missing motion package (12.23.22) in lock file that was present in package.json
- Corrected lock file's @next/env and @next/swc-* packages version inconsistencies
